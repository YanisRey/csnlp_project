<h1>The MEN Test Collection</h1>

<strong>Version:</strong> 0.2<br>

<h2>Overview</h2>

The <strong>MEN Test Collection</strong> contains two sets of English word pairs 
(one for training and one for testing) together with human-assigned similarity judgments,
obtained by crowdsourcing using 
<a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a> via the
<a href="http://crowdflower.com/">CrowdFlower</a> interface. 
The collection can be used to train and/or test computer algorithms implementing 
semantic similarity and relatedness measures.


<h2>Description</h2>

<strong>Sampling</strong>: The MEN data set consists of 3,000 word pairs, randomly
selected from words that occur at least 700 times in the freely available 
<a href="http://wacky.sslmit.unibo.it/">ukWaC and Wackypedia corpora combined</a> 
(size: 1.9B and 820M tokens, respectively) 
and at least 50 times (<strong>as tags</strong>) in the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/">opensourced subset</a> 
of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP_game">ESP game dataset</a>. 
In order to avoid picking unrelated pairs only, we sampled the pairs so that they 
represent a balanced range of relatedness levels according to a text-based semantic score.

<p>
<strong>Design and data collection</strong>: Each pair was randomly matched with a
comparison pair and rated in this setting (as either more or less
related than the comparison point) by a single Turker (hence, there is
no well-defined inter-subject agreement). 
Rather than ask annotators to give an absolute score reflecting how
much a word pair is semantically related (like in 
<a href="http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~gabr/resources/data/wordsim353/wordsim353.html">Wordsim353</a>), 
we instead asked them to make comparative judgements on two pair exemplars at a time because
this is both more natural for an individual annotator, and
also permits seamless integration of the supervision from
many annotators, each of whom may have a different internal "calibration"
for the relatedness strengths.
Moreover, binary choices were preferred because they make the construction of
"right" and "wrong" control items straightforward.
In total, each pair was
rated in this way against 50 comparison pairs, thus obtaining a final
score on a 50-point scale, although the Turkers' choices were binary. 
<p>
<strong>Instructions</strong>: We did not instruct the subjects about the difference
between similarity and relatedness. We used only the second term, and
gave examples involving both similarity, that is a special case of
relatedness ("car-automobile"), and relatedness ("wheels-car").

<p>
<strong>Participants</strong>: We requested participants to be native speakers and only
accepted those connecting from an English speaking country. We cannot
guarantee that non-natives did not take part in the study, but our
subject filtering techniques based on control "gold standard" pairs
ensures that only the data of speakers with a good command of English
were retained.
<p>
<strong>Agreement</strong>: Because raters saw the MEN pairs matched to 
different random items, with the number of pairs also varying from rater 
to rater, it is not possible to compute annotator agreement scores for MEN. 
However, to get a sense of human agreement, the first and third author 
rated all 3,000 pairs (presented in different random orders) on a 
standard 1-7 Likert scale. The Spearman correlation of the two authors 
is at 0.68, the correlation of their average ratings with the MEN 
scores is at 0.84. On the one hand, this high correlation suggests 
that MEN contains meaningful semantic ratings. On the other, it can 
also be taken as an upper bound on what computational models can 
realistically achieve when simulating the human MEN judgments.
<p>
All sets (<b>development</b>, <b>testing</b> and <b>combined</b>) are available in two formats:
<ul>
<li>POS-tagged form - see files with the <strong>lemma_form</strong> suffix
<li>Natural form - see files with the <strong>natural_form</strong> suffix
</ul>
The first two columns in each file contain word pairs, followed by a column with the
(floating-point) human scores.
